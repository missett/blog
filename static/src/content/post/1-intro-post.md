# Intro Post
I really need a project to work on that achieves a few different goals for me right now, things that I feel I'm lacking personally or professionally. In no particular order these are-
- Practise writing about technical subjects.
- A way to develop AWS skills as part of a new role I'll be starting soon.
- A creative outlet of some kind.
- Experience with modern JavaScript development.
I'm hoping this blog will let me fulfill at least some of these goals. 

## The Plan
In so far as I have any plan for this thing at all, in my mind it goes roughly like this-
1) Choose a technology for content management. This should allow me to write posts in markdown. Ideally it should include a theme system (since I have absolutely no design skills).
2) Get it online for as little money as possible, with a CD pipeline that allows me to open PRs on a repo that deploys new posts to a staging environment and then merging to master promotes the post to prod.
3) Eventually shift over to AWS in some way.
4) Make the site slightly more dynamic so that I can take advantage of some of the more complex features of AWS (maybe a database, a few lambdas etc).

With any luck, the next post should cover the chosen technology for the content of the site!
